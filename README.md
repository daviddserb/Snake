# Minesweeper - Game Clone in JavaScript

Rediscover the classic Snake game with a modern twist â€“ now, bumping into the walls won't end your journey. Instead, seamlessly teleport to the opposite side and keep the game alive. You also can use the Pause button for more control over your Snake adventure.

Playing Instructions:
- Navigate the board using arrow keys (Up, Right, Down, Left).
- Need a breather? Use the Pause button to halt the game and plan your next moves temporarily.
- Achieve victory by growing the snake to fill the entire grid.
- The only way to lose is by colliding with yourself.
